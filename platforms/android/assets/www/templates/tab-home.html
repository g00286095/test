					As Chair of Dúchas na Gaillimhe – Galway Civic Trust, it is my great pleasure 
					to present Galway City Waterways Walks to the people of Galway and visitors to 
					our city. The walks along the River Corrib and associated watercourses have been 
					described both as a ‘Hidden Treasure in the Heart of Galway’ and as the ‘Venice of the North’, 
					both descriptions are indeed appropriate.
					<br><br>
					It is our hope that people will use this booklet to take time out to enjoy a leisurely city 
					centre stroll, revisiting the locations of an area which was the industrial heart of the city 
					in times past and see other more recent features along the way while also enjoying the wide 
					variety of birds and plants.
					<br><br>
					In addition to the extensive conservation and restoration projects undertaken by Galway Civic 
					Trust in the past sixteen years, this publication is another initiative in Constructively Caring 
					for Your Local Heritage. The Directors of Dúchas na Gaillimhe hope that young people, parents and teachers will use this guide on visits to the city and perhaps enjoy a picnic along the way. For further details of the work of the Trust, please visit www. galwaycivictrust.ie.
					A special word of thanks goes to our Development Officer, Michael Quinn, who undertook this 
					project and brought it to completion. Thanks also to Fáilte Ireland West for generous sponsorship, 
					which enables us to present this booklet free of charge.

					 The River Corrib starts its voyage just north of Galway city, where it flows from the lake 
					 of the same name – Lough Corrib. At 176 square kilometres this is Ireland’s second largest 
					 lake: it extends north to the towns of Headford and Cong, while westward it stretches into 
					 the Connemara region. From here the river meanders along its six kilometre journey, picking 
					 up speed as it enter the city on its way to empty into the mighty Atlantic Ocean.
					 <br><br>
					 The Corrib has long been the main artery of the city and as far back as the Stone Age its banks were 
					 home to some of the earliest settlers in Ireland, who valued its abundant supply of salmon and trout. 
					 Right through the Bronze and Iron Ages up to the arrival of Christianity in the fifth century the 
					 Corrib supported human habitation, and much of our archaeological evidence from these periods stems 
					 from the remains of settlements along the river or indeed from artefacts found in its waters. In 
					 fact the flooding of the area by the Corrib at times of high water gave rise to the early Gaelic 
					 name for Galway – Baile na Sruthán (the village of the streams) – as small islands surrounded by 
					 rivulets were formed on the site of the modern city. The present name of Galway is also thought to 
					 be closely associated with the River Corrib. According to mythology, Galvia, daughter of King Breasil, 
					 threw herself into the Corrib and it is from her that the city derives its name.
					 <br><br>
					 With the arrival of the Anglo-Normans in the medieval period the original settlement began to grow. 
					 In the thirteenth century the de Burgo family found that with the natural defences of the sea to the 
					 south and the river to the west, the area could easily be secured. As the town began to take to shape 
					 and expand under the fourteen Anglo-Norman ‘Tribes’, the River Corrib remained an important defensive 
					 barrier while its waters became a valuable source of fishing revenue during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
					<br><br>
					 By the ninteenth century, the Corrib was being utilised to power the many mills which had been erected along 
					 its banks – it being noted by a visitor to the city that the river’s ‘mighty volume of water would 
					 turn all the mills in Manchester’. Though Galway and the wider country were experiencing a period of 
					 decline at this time, the water-powered mini ‘industrial revolution’ which the city embraced undoubtedly 
					 helped to maintain a degree of local economic stability throughout an otherwise bleak period. In the 
					 twentieth century the Corrib became associated with sports and recreation as it frequently hosted highly 
					 popular rowing competitions and regattas. As tourism increased, leisure cruises up to Lough Corrib also 
					 became fashionable among the gentry.
					 <br><br>
					 Today, the natural, historic and social features of the River Corrib still manage to charm both residents 
					 and visitors. The sight of a fisherman hooking a salmon commonly halts and fascinates passers-by on 
					 Salmon Weir Bridge, while a leisurely stroll along some of the city’s more secluded backwaters is a 
					 perfect retreat from the hum of the modern city and is an ideal opportunity to view the flora and 
					 fauna for which the Corrib and its associated waterways are home. So come with us as we take in the 
					 many pleasures of the city’s river systems on <b>The Galway City Waterways Walk.</b>

					 The compilation of this booklet has been assisted by a number of people to whom a debt of 
					 gratitude is owed. Firstly, to Gordon D’Arcy who compiled a previous waterway guide for 
					 Galway Civic Trust. In fact, Gordon’s brochure was the inspiration for this booklet and 
					 much of his original text concerning wildlife and ecology has been reproduced in this 
					 publication. Advice and images for the booklet were also gratefully received from Brendan 
					 Smith of the Natural Environment and Waterways Group (of which Galway Trust is also a member). 
					 This strategic policy group which operates under the auspices of the Council’s Galway City 
					 Development Board is dedicated to the protection and promotion of the city’s natural amenities. 
					 Indeed, a collaborative effort between NEWG and Galway Civic Trust – to rename a number of 
					 the city’s watercourses – became the catalyst for the research of this work.
					 <br><br>
					 Thanks are also due to Paul Duffy and Seamus Hartigan for their respective factual amendments, 
					 as well as to Dr Mark McCarthy of GMIT and Professor Noel Wilkins of NUIG for their patient 
					 and diligent proof-reading of the text. A number of photographs by Ronan Bree which appear 
					 on the cover and in the interior did much to enhance this booklet and to him I am deeply 
					 indebted. More of Ronan’s work can be found at www. ronanbree.com. Other photographs were 
					 also kindly supplied by Neil Warner, Sean McCormack and Frank Clarke.
					 <br><br>
					 Credit is due to Ray O’Donnell and Darina McCarthy of Tela Design for their original ideas and 
					 design of the booklet. The assistance of staff at the Galway County Library and those at the 
					 photographic archive of the National Library of Ireland is also duly acknowledged. A special 
					 word of thanks, finally, to the Board of Directors of Galway Civic Trust who encouraged this 
					 project from the outset.
